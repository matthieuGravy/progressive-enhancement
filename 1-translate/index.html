          In nature, Good & Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither

          Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that
          rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing
          cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and
          there’s no such thing as an issue.
